## Jenkins vs Kubernetes: What are the differences?

# Jenkins: 
```
- An extendable open source continuous integration server. 
- In a nutshell Jenkins CI is the leading open-source continuous integration server. 
- Built with Java, it provides over 300 plugins to support building and testing virtually any project; 
```
# Kubernetes: 
```
- Manage a cluster of Linux containers as a single system to accelerate Dev and simplify Ops. 
- Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. 
- It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions.
```

- Jenkins and Kubernetes are primarily classified as "Continuous Integration" and "Container" tools respectively.

Some of the features offered by Jenkins are:
```
- Easy installation
- Easy configuration
- Change set support
```
On the other hand, Kubernetes provides the following key features:
```
- Lightweight, simple and accessible
- Built for a multi-cloud world, public, private or hybrid
- Highly modular, designed so that all of its components are easily swappable
```
## Key factors

2. "Free open source" and 
3. "Great to build, deploy or launch anything async";

### Kubernetes
1. "Leading docker container management solution", 
2. "Simple and powerful" and 
3. "Open source" are the primary reasons why Kubernetes is favored.
